# **DJXp**

### Function
A crude application for one to have the **DJ experience**. The application allows one to create song lists and save 
them as sets to be loaded & played whenever. The application lets users edit set content and sets themselves. 
Various current and next song information is displayed to the user as well as set information. Users are able to 
choose, then  view and listen to their sets in real-time. Various useful DJ & producer tools are available to the 
user to have control over the set and perform in real-time. For a more detailed overview of the program's functions, 
please refer to the "User Stories" Section below.


### Audience
**DJ**s & **Producer**s would be the main target audience, while it also contains features useful for the average joe
(though there are other programs better suited for that).


### Value
I'm big into multimedia. I do graphic design, edit video, and of course, **I produce music**. So why not combine 
(at least) one of those with another passionâ€”programming. I'm also only into the producing side of the industry, with 
a history in performance. I've never delved into the realm of DJ-ing even though producers are mostly DJs and DJs are 
mostly producers; so this is a good opportunity for me to get into it.
