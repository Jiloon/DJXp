# **DJXp**

### Function
A crude application for one to have the **DJ experience**. The application allows one to create song lists and save 
them as sets to be loaded & played whenever. The application lets users edit set content and sets themselves. 
Various current and next song information is displayed to the user as well as set information. Users are able to 
choose, then  view and listen to their sets in real-time. Various useful DJ & producer tools are available to the 
user to have control over the set and perform in real-time. For a more detailed overview of the program's functions, 
please refer to the "User Stories" Section below.


### Audience
**DJ**s & **Producer**s would be the main target audience, while it also contains features useful for the average joe
(though there are other programs better suited for that).


### Value
I'm big into multimedia. I do graphic design, edit video, and of course, **I produce music**. So why not combine 
(at least) one of those with another passionâ€”programming. I'm also only into the producing side of the industry, with 
a history in performance. I've never delved into the realm of DJ-ing even though producers are mostly DJs and DJs are 
mostly producers; so this is a good opportunity for me to get into it.

# Phase 4: Task 3
Each of my classes is doing way too much. Each class is handling multiple tasks, making it cluttered and really not
straightforward. The Song class is mostly fine, although I could think of possibly splitting the MP3 parser into a
separate class and just have 1 singular universal MP3 parser instance that handles all the mp3 parsing, and then
acquire the data from the song class. The Playback class is the meat of the program, which in other words means
it handles way too much. The actual audio handler should be completely separate, while the rest should be split into
a song handler and a set handler. The GUI & ConsoleUI are both single classes which should really be split into
more bite-sized portions. It's just one big blob now while they should be split into more organized sections of the
UI. The model can also make use of more interfaces for less replicated code.

Furthermore, I feel that I misplaced some work loads. As of now, the UIs handle the user input, which is completely
right, but it then sends raw user inputted strings straight to the playback object, and the playback object converts
the user inputted strings into their appropriate objects, and then applies the respective function on that object.
There should be an intermediary class that handles the conversion from user inputted strings into the objects, then
sends those objects to have their function applied to them. It's just more straightforward and a cleaner design that
way.
